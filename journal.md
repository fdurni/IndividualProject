###1/26/16
I began researching dashboard design and creating a mockup for my landing page after a user logs in. 

##Week 2
###2/2/16
Continued researching dashboard design and creating a mockup for my landing page after a user logs in. Debating if I want to utilize bootstrap or start from scratch. 

###2/3/16
I worked on Week 2 exercises, which dealt with unit testing. I had not worked with unit testing before, and so I spent time researching unit testing because I wasn't sure how to get started. Completing the week 2 exercises took a lot longer than I anticipated. I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work that will be required for this class and the amount of time that I have to spend. 

In class, my VM was very unstable and froze/crashed on several occasions. Instead of trying to work with the VM, I am going to re-setup my environment on my laptop. 

##Week 3
###2/4/16
I spent a few hours re-setting up my environment. Most things seem to be working, except deploying a WAR using tomcat. I will need to troubleshoot this more soon. 

###2/7/16
Yesterday I spent the entire day working on a project for another class, so I wasn't able to work on anything for this class. Today, I worked on the exercises for Week 3 and began looking over a bootstrap theme. The bootstrap files contain so much information that I'm not sure where to start. It may be easier to start from scratch and only add-in what I need, rather than trying to delete what I don't need. 

###2/8/16
I found a free template for a dashboard that works off of bootstrap. The code is very well commented, which would make it easy to figure out how the code all works together. A blank template is also provided, so that the user can add in the content they want. Many examples are also provided. I've forked the GitHub repository, and will tenatively plan to use this in my project. 

###2/9/16
I'm not sure where the weeks have gone. I feel really overwhelmed trying to do so many things at once. This class is by far the most challenging/demanding class I've ever taken. At times I've felt like it just might be too much for me to take on with my 3 other classes, working fulltime, being a fulltime mom, and trying to somehow fit my training sessions for powerlifting in.

In just this class, I'm tryng to learn many new things (Intellij, Git, Github, unit testing, Hibernate, etc), keep up with the weekly exercises, find extracurricular/volunteer opportunities, and find time to work on my individual project. Tomorrow we already have a code review and I feel like I have barely started on my project. I've spent so much time working on the exercises and setting up my environment that I have had very little time to work on my project. 

Today, I took a first cut at my database design and created an ERD in visio. I then created the tables in my local database. I think that I may need to modify my tables slightly, but this should give me a good starting point. I also created my JSP pages. 

###2/14/16
Finally, I had some time to work on my project. I changed User in my database to Person, as this seemed to make more sense for my application. I still need to finish up work on the DAO, but I feel like I have a better understanding of how the DAO is working. I got many of my JSPs set up, and a lot of the HTML in the JSPs complete. I used bootstrap for my template, which was fairly easy to use and customize. I would definitely recommend bootstrap to others; this seems like a great resource. I was able to finish my database design, which I had been struggling with the past couple of weeks. I also set up my database within Intellij. I feel much better about where my project is at after code reviews last week, and the progress I was able to make today.
