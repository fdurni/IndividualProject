# Felicia's Individual Project

###Problem Statement
Many powerlifters rely on spreadsheets or notebooks to document their training schedules and keep track of their workouts. There is not a website that allows a user to input their training schedule, determines if any Personal Records (PRs) were set, and shows progression over time. 

I would like to build a website that will allow me to input my training schedule and view my routines for the current week.
